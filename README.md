# particle-kriging
Particle Kriging contains scripts for the Apache Airflow workflow management tool that is used to build a learning and prediction system that teaches an algorithm based on the geostatistical "Ordinary Kriging" method at periodic intervals and predicts particulate matter for locations without a measurement station. Additionally, a validation framework will also be set up to demonstrate the functional performance of the algorithm through cross-validation and to optimize the hyperparameters using grid-search.
